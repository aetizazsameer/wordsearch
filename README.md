wordsearch/README.md

This program was adapted from another program I made in school. The original program could be used to determine whether
particular words are present in a word search puzzle. However, it was impossible to specify words and enter a custom
word search. Additionally, it did not give the location of words on the word search, and the word search could only be
square.
This program is a significant improvement over the original; it can determine whether words are present in the word
search and give their locations as well, even if the word appears multiple times in the puzzle. Additionally, the words,
word search, and dimensions of the word search can be specified by the user, as long as the word search is rectangular,
making this program ideal for solving difficult word search puzzles. I tried to make this program as simple and
user-friendly as possible, and I'd like to think I ultimately succeeded.
This is my second upload to Github (in accordance with a longstanding tradition of computing, hello-world was my first).
I'll upload more of my recent projects soon. Until then, though, feedback and criticism are appreciated! Thanks for
reading and taking a look at this program!
